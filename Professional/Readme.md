* We could not use all **hooks** inside *regular function*, only we can use in the `components` only.
* So, for **useParams** there is inbuilt `request` is there and for **useNavigate** there is inbuilt `redirect` function are there.
* At posting to the server, 1st request hit at the respected `action` block and call the api.
* And at the `method` property only takes **POST**,**PATCH** and **PUT** not **GET**.
